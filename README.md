Virtual Onboarding in Metaverse(AR) 
An employee's first few months at a new organisation are crucial since they must quickly learn complex processes, assimilate a wealth of knowledge, and begin contributing. They could feel disoriented and unmotivated if there is no clear direction.
Your employees have a fantastic opportunity to network at work and gather the knowledge they need to easily transition into a new position.
Unfortunately, there is a communication gap due to the culture of remote labour. New hires frequently engage with other teams very little to not at all. Ironically, many businesses neglect to give new workers networking chances to get to know other teams while they are being onboarded.
The pandemic of 2020 pushed a lot of businesses to discover a work-from-home.
